OpenModel is a Windows application for formulating, visualising and calibrating numerical models with minimal coding overhead.  
Originally distributed through **openmodel.info** (now offline), it was created and maintained by **Prof. Neil Crout** (School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, UK). This repository preserves the final public build so that researchers and students can continue to access the software.

> “OpenModel is freely available mathematical modelling software for Windows…  
> A notable feature is its integration of model parameterisation, i.e. adjusting model parameters to fit observations.”

> **Why an installer and not source code?**  
> OpenModel was released only as a compiled binary. No source code was ever published by the author, so none is redistributed here.
